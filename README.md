# PokeSite üêæ

A simple site that picks a random Pok√©mon from Pok√©API and retrieves basic information about it, including:
  - In-Game Sprite
  - Name
  - ID
  - Sound Effect

This site was made in one afternoon, to help understand how to use an API, fetch data from it, and to manipulate elements in HTML dynamically.
This would not be possible without the work of [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and its many contributors.
